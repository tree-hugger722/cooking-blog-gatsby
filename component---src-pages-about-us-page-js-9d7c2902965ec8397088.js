For anyone who has shared one of those meals with us, you know we're not experts, and we don't aim for fine dining. We like simple food, creative food, fresh food, colorful food, and good company with which to eat it. Quarantine gave the two of us the chance to cook together again. Many of our friends and family have also chosen to spend more time cooking together, and have taken the time to try new recipes.
